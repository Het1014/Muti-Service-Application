## Concepts Used

This program demonstrates the following programming concepts:

- **Functions:** Functions are used to encapsulate reusable blocks of code, enhancing modularity and readability.
- **Classes:** Classes are used to encapsulate related data and functions, enabling object-oriented programming principles.
- **Conditionals:** Conditionals such as `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.
- **Loops:** Loops such as `for` and `while` loops are used to execute blocks of code repeatedly until certain conditions are met.
- **Reference Variables:** Reference variables are used to alias an existing variable, allowing multiple names to refer to the same memory location.
- **Validations:** Input validations are performed to ensure that user input meets specified criteria.
- **String Manipulation:** String manipulation techniques are used to process and manipulate strings, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and character manipulation.
- **Arrays:** Arrays are used to store collections of data of the same type, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is achieved through the use of classes to hide the implementation details of data and functions, promoting information hiding and abstraction.
- **Pointers:** Pointers are used to store memory addresses, enabling dynamic memory allocation and manipulation.
- **Inheritance:** Inheritance is used to create new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes), allowing for code reuse and hierarchy.
- **Structure:** Structures are used to define custom data types containing multiple fields, enabling the organization and manipulation of related data.
- **Time Manipulation:** Time manipulation functions are used to retrieve and manipulate system time, allowing for timestamp generation and time-based operations.
